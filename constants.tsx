# The Ghost in the Shell

Why do we keep building the same websites?
Containers, padding, white space, accessibility... it's all so... expected.

This domain, pamungkas.org, is my digital residue. It's not here to follow your rules.
It's here to exist as a terminal of thought.

Stay tuned for more updates on system architecture and the beauty of broken things.
